Exactly—there are several “meta-ML” libraries that let you spin up and compare a dozen+ regressors or classifiers with almost zero boilerplate. A few of the most popular:

1. PyCaret (Python)
A lightweight, low-code wrapper around scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, etc.

python
Copy
Edit
# pip install pycaret
from pycaret.regression import setup, compare_models

# 1) initialize your experiment
exp = setup(data=df, target='y', silent=True, session_id=42)

# 2) train and rank all models
best = compare_models()
print(best)
Pros: interactive HTML report, ensembling & blending built-in, simple tune_model()/predict_model() APIs.
When to use: quick benchmarking in interviews or prototypes.

2. LazyPredict (Python)
A super-minimal tool that fits 40+ models in one call and returns a DataFrame of metrics.

python
Copy
Edit
# pip install lazypredict
from lazypredict.Supervised import LazyRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)
reg = LazyRegressor(predictions=False)
models, predictions = reg.fit(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
print(models)  # DataFrame of RMSE, R², fit/predict times
Pros: zero-config, super-fast overview.
When to use: lightning-fast sanity check on “which families look promising.”

3. TPOT (Python)
An AutoML library that uses genetic programming to both pick models and tune hyperparameters.

python
Copy
Edit
# pip install tpot
from tpot import TPOTRegressor

tpot = TPOTRegressor(generations=5, population_size=20, verbosity=2, random_state=42)
tpot.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(tpot.score(X_test, y_test))
tpot.export('tpot_pipeline.py')
Pros: fully automated pipeline discovery.
When to use: when you want both model selection and hyperparameter optimization.

4. auto-sklearn (Python)
Built on Bayesian optimization—searches model/hyperparameter space intelligently.

python
Copy
Edit
# pip install auto-sklearn
import autosklearn.regression

automl = autosklearn.regression.AutoSklearnRegressor(time_left_for_this_task=300, per_run_time_limit=30)
automl.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(automl.show_models())
Pros: robust AutoML, handles feature preprocessing automatically.
When to use: when you have a bit more time budget and want a mature AutoML engine.

5. caret (R)
The old-school swiss-army knife of ML in R—compare dozens of models via a single train() call.

r
Copy
Edit
# install.packages("caret")
library(caret)

fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)
models <- caretList(
  y ~ ., data = df,
  trControl = fitControl,
  methodList = c("lm", "ridge", "lasso", "rf", "gbm")
)
resamps <- resamples(models)
summary(resamps)
Pros: familiar to R users, integrates with dozens of packages.
When to use: interviewing on an R‐centric role or demoing in R.

Quick Interview Tip
Name your tool (“I like PyCaret for its simplicity…”)

Show a 2–line snippet in pseudocode.

Call out trade-offs (e.g. “LazyPredict is super fast but doesn’t tune hyperparameters”).

That way you demonstrate both familiarity and critical judgment—no need to hand-write 10 model pipelines by hand!
